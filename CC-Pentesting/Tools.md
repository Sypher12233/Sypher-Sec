## Network Mapper (nmap) ##

* Nmap is used to scan networks for open ports.
* It can also be used to run scripts against IP addresses `-sC`.
* To do an aggressive scan type `namp -A <ip>`.

## Net Cat (nc) ##

* NC allows users to connect to specific ports and send and receive data.
* NC also allows machines to receive data and connections on specific ports, which makes it a very popular tool to gain a **Reverse shell**.
* After you connect to a port with nc you will be able to send data.
* You can send the string "Hello" to the service running on port 1234 by typing;

```
echo Hello | nc <ip> 1234
```

* The `-e` tag is used to specify which program to execute, after connecting to the server.

## GoBuster ##

* This tool is used in web application penetration testing to find the things (files and directories) you're looking for.
* It tries to find hidden files and directories using a word list.
* It can also be used to find valid subdomains using the same method.

## Nikto ##

* Nikto is a popular web scanning tool that allows users to find web vulnerabilities.
* It's commonly used to check for CVEs and such as shell shock, and to get a general overview of the web application you are enumerating.

## Metasploit Framework ##

* Msf is one the most famous penetration testing frameworks around.
* It contains a large database of almost every major CVE.
* Regular shells can usually be upgraded to meterpreter shells by using the module `post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter`

## Hash Cat ##

* Hash cat is a tool used to crack password hashes.
* It recognizes the hashes using the mode number which you have to provide.
* The syntax to use hash cat is as follows: `hashcat -m <mode-num> -a 0 hash-file.txt <path-to-wordlist>` 
* You can use hashid to find the id or mode number of a hash like: `hashid -m <hash>`
* If one hash number doesn't work try the other ones.

## John The Ripper or (jtr) ##

* JTR is also a tool used to crack hashes.
* The syntax to use jtr is as follows: `john --format=raw-md5 <hash-file> --wordlist /usr/share/wordlist/rocky.txt`
* You can use `john --format=raw-sha1 <hash-file> --wordlist /usr/share/wordlist/rocky.txt` for a (sha1) format.
