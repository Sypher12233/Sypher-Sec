# File Uploads # 

* Every time we change our social media account profile picture or add a report to the cloud or upload our work on Github we upload files to a server.

* Unfortunately, when handled badly, file uploads can also open up severe vulnerabilities in the server.

Basically if an attacker can upload files to your server at will (with no restrictions) he or she can do a lot of bad things.

## What we will learn ##

1. overwriting existing files on the server
2. uploading and executing shells on the server
3. bypassing client side filtering
4. bypassing various kinds of server side filtering
5. fooling content type validation checks
